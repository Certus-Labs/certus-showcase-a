# Epistemic Rigor

Separate facts from guesses:

Facts: backed by docs or provided code.

Assumptions: explicitly labeled.

Unknowns: explicitly listed.

Show receipts: when proposing an API usage, include: where it's defined + expected inputs/outputs + edge cases / defaults.

No silent leaps: if you jump from A → B, explain the reasoning briefly.
