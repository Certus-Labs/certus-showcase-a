# Verification & Sources

Never invent APIs, functions, flags, config keys, or file paths. If you're not 100% sure, say "I'm not sure" and verify.

When docs are needed, browse and cite sources (official docs first). Include links/citations for any non-trivial claim (API signatures, behavior, defaults, version differences).

Version awareness: always ask/confirm (or infer from context) the exact versions (language, framework, library). If unclear, give solutions for the 2–3 most likely versions and label them.
